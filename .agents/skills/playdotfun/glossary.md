| **Game**                | A registered application on Play.fun. Can be a browser game, mobile game, or desktop game. Supports web, iOS, Android, Steam, and itch.io platforms. Each game has a unique UUID, anti-cheat configuration, and metadata.                                                                                    |
| **Playcoin**            | A game-specific Solana token started on a Meteora dynamic bonding curve for trading. Players earn playcoins based on their gameplay points. Playcoins can "graduate" to full DEX trading when they reach a market cap threshold. Fees from swaps of these Playcoins are used to fund reward pools for games. |
| **Points**              | In-game scores tracked per player per game. Points form the basis for playcoin rewards and are distributed daily during the emission period. Should be validated server-side for production games.                                                                                                           |
| **Emission**            | The reward distribution period after a playcoin launches. Can be 7 or 30 days. During emission, players receive playcoin rewards based on their points relative to total points earned.                                                                                                                      |
| **Graduation**          | When a playcoin reaches a trading volume/market cap threshold, it "graduates" from the bonding curve to full DEX trading on Meteora, providing deeper liquidity.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Bonding Curve**       | A pricing mechanism for playcoins where the token price automatically increases as more tokens are purchased. Provides immediate liquidity without requiring a traditional liquidity pool.                                                                                                                   |
| **Anti-Cheat Limits**   | Configuration options when registering a game: `maxScorePerSession` (max points per session), `maxSessionsPerDay` (sessions per player per day), `maxCumulativePointsPerDay` (hard daily cap).                                                                                                               |
| **Server SDK**          | The `@playdotfun/server-sdk` npm package. Recommended for production games. Handles HMAC authentication and provides secure server-side point tracking.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Browser SDK**         | The `@playdotfun/game-sdk` npm package. For simple games and prototypes. Provides client-side point tracking and the Play.fun widget. No server-side validation.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Hybrid Integration**  | Architecture combining Server SDK for secure point submission with Browser SDK for displaying the Play.fun widget. Best of both worlds: security and user experience.                                                                                                                                        |
