# Silicon Lobster Stack Rules

## Core Stack
- Use Three.js and GSAP only; keep physics manual with axis-aligned overlap checks.
- Alternate block motion axis each turn: `X`, then `Z`, then repeat.
- On place input, compute overlap against previous block and chop overhang.
- Trigger game over if overlap on the active axis is `<= 0`.

## Scoring And Messaging
- Track and surface both `Alchemical Gold` score and stack height.
- On game over, always send:
  - `window.parent.postMessage({ type: 'SCORE', value: score }, '*')`

## Visual Direction
- Keep a minimalist industrial look: metallic materials, soft rounding, clean UI.
- Include lobster theming on block tops and chop effects.
- Every 15 placed blocks, rotate material tier:
  - Silver -> Space Gray -> Midnight -> Neon accent style.

## Performance
- Prioritize iframe-friendly runtime behavior.
- Reuse geometry/material instances when practical.
- Avoid per-frame allocations and cap transient effects.
- Dispose temporary meshes, textures, and materials after use.
